\usage{
graph(..., penalty = 0, type = "empty", gap = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{This is a list of edges definied by functions edge and StartEnd}

\item{penalty}{a nonnegative number equals to the common penalty to use for all edges}

\item{type}{a string equal to "std", "isotonic", "updown", "infsup". to build a predefined classic graph}
}
\value{
a dataframe with edges in rows (columns are named "state1", "state2", "type", "penalty", "parameter") with additional "graph" class.
}
\description{
Graph creation using component function Edge, StartEnd, Node
}
\examples{
UpDownGraph <- graph(penalty = 10, type = "updown")
MyGraph <- graph(Edge(0,0), Edge(1,1), Edge(0,1,"up",10,gap=0.5), Edge(1,0,"down"), StartEnd(0,0), Node(0,0,1), Node(1,0,1))
}
