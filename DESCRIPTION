Title: Graph-constrained Functional Pruning Optimal Partitioning 
Version: 0.1.2
Author: Vincent Runge
Maintainer: Vincent Runge <vincent.runge@univ-evry.fr>
Description: Penalized parametric changepoint detection by functional pruning dynamic programming algorithm. The successive means can be constrained using a graph structure with edge of type null, up, down, std or absSup. To each edge we can use an additional nonnegative parameter allowing us to force a minimal gap between two successive means. The user can also constraint the infered means to lie between some minimal and maximal values. Data is modelized by a quadratic cost with possible use of a robust loss, biweight and Huber. In a next version of this package, other parametric losses will be available (L1, Poisson, binomial).
